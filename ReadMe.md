## Part 1: The Code

### Description
This section contains the firmware code written for the LED matrix. The code is designed to run on a microcontroller using PlatformIO, managing the LED matrix behaviors, animations, and hardware interactions.

### Project Structure
- **src/**: Contains the main firmware source files.
- **platformio.ini**: Configuration file for PlatformIO, defining environment settings and build parameters.

## Part 2: Python Interface

### Description
The Python interface facilitates communication between your computer and the LED matrix device.
It allows testing of LED patterns via a user-friendly script.
